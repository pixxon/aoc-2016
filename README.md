# Advent of Code - 2016
After finding the [website](http://adventofcode.com/) I figured it would be nice to complete it and also save my solutions.

My solution for each day can be found in the corresponding directory.  
I'll include the input file, in case it gets deleted or lost somehow.  
These codes are cleaned up and reworked compared to the one I use to solve the puzzles.
